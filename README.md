# Hi 🍍 !


🍍 Hey, I'm A1ex and I'm a CS Student. 🍍


I discovered development almost 5 years ago when I wanted to create a Discord bot.  
Since then, I've been doing projects, self-hosting (because it's cool, especially Vaultwarden and Nextcloud) and other cool stuff.


## 📁 My Active Projects
Here are the 2 main projects I'm working on now:  

- [**Monika**](https://monika.gg): My main activity is to maintain the development of my Discord bot I created, **Monika**, created 4 years ago to introduce myself to development, and which is now on more than 10k servers.

- [**Koya**](https://koya.gg): I'm also part of the development team of **Koya**, created by [@Koyamie](https://github.com/Koyamie), a discord bot now present on more than 2 million servers for a few million daily users.

I mainly code my projects in JavaScript, TS, and more recently in C. 

## 📱 Contacting Me
If you have any questions, want to contact me or anything else, I'm available on Discord (a6ex), or by mail (in my GitHub bio).   
However I don't guarantee any answer because I'm too lazy to answer.
