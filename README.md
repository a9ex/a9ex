# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub!  

🍍 Hi, I’m **A1ex**!  
**Software Engineer** since 2023 in a cool scale-up, a computer science student in parallel, and a fan of building cool projects.

## 🎯 About Me  
I first dived into development nearly 8 years ago while creating my very first Discord bot.  
Since then, I’ve been crafting projects, experimenting with self-hosting (because let’s face it, it’s awesome – shoutout to Vaultwarden, Nextcloud and much more), and exploring cool tech ideas.

### [**Monika**](https://monika.gg)  
I maintain **Monika**, my personal Discord bot that started as my entry point into development 7 years ago.  
Today, Monika is active on over **10,000 servers**. Though I haven’t actively developed it for a while due to time constraints, I make sure it keeps running smoothly.
